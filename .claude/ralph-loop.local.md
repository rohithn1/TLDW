Task overview and UX: 
    Build a simple CLI tool that summarizes Youtube videos. Users should be able to execute to install the command on their Mac or Linux environment with a simple CURL installation command. Once install the tool must require the user to select which model they'd like to use from a list of LLM choices and providers. Initally include anthropic/claude-opus-4 and openai/gpt-5 and use openrouter style naming with the format provider/model. 

    Once the user sets up their model of choice they must be able to envoke tke CLI tool in the following manner: tldw https://www.youtube.com/videourl --gimme specific context. As you can see in this example command there needs to be the ability to pass in an argument with a simple guiding prompt for the user to tell the CLI tool what specific information they are interested in. 

    Once the user clicks enter show a loading animation in the terminal until the query is done processing. Once the summary has been generated (enither generally or focused around the prompt the user provided) the CLI must return a simple 1 phrase summary followed by indepth summaries broken into various sections. Each section must link back to a timestamp in the youtube video and provide the link for the user to visit that section of the video and start watching from there.

    Make sure the tone and voice of the LLM summaries are very laid back and chiill.

Technical implementation:
    Make sure to use python and uv.
    First use the youtube transcript API to retreive the English subtitles for the video: https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api -- they can either be autogenerated or an official captain track. Make sure to save these captions in a temporary local file on disk including the timestamp for each caption line or phrase -- whatever they are split by. 
    Then pass the context of the video to the LLM with a prompt to extract the most relevent information in general or with respect to the context the user provided. Once the LLM generates the summary along with the quotes which back that summary up match the LLM provided quotation to the previously saved video transcript. If the quote does not exist in the transcript reprompt the LLM explaining that it did not quote a valid part of the video. Once all valid quotes are received print the text to the screen using formatting and ASCII art to make the information visually easy to digest. Each section must also provide a generated timestamp link back to the original video.

Testing:
    Test the functionality with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJB4wf4ei3Q. The user prompt should be what happened in scotland? and the correct answer is something along the lines of Russian sailors were adbucted by the US miliary. Followed hy a more detailed description and a link back to the video at timestamp 3:46 give or take a 5 seconds. 

    When testing use my existing login for claude code to setup my LLM access.

    Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when done.
